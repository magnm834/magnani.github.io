				<h1>PROJECT</h1>
				<P>The idea behind this project was to develop one, or several booklets inspired in a color we got assigned. I was given brown as my color, and after doing some research about the psychology of the color I realized it was often a very overlooked and rejected color, which led me to created a four booklet compillation discussing overlooked things in society. The topics were homelessness, health care, gun control and the lgbtq community. Some of the type was treated in unespected ways that often break the rules of typography to make compelling visual ques for the reader to develop an interest in the content. The bulk of the content; however, was carefully set by using a 2 column grid system and margins.</P>
