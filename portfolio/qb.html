				<h1>PROJECT</h1>
				<P>After such a casatrophic event in 2011, the subway station right beneath the twin towers was completely destroyed, leaving a scar in New York City's financial distrcit. The purpose of this project was to capture the pure and sterile aesthetic Santiago Calatrava gave this building. Making it not only an architectural masterpiece, but also a building that sybolizes the rebirth of this area of the city that for many years was a painful remainder of the events that took place on September 11.</P>
